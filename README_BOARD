hey so basically ive done some basic testing on this class and everything seems to be working.

You can read through the code and see if it makes sense (it should, hopefully haha)
but pretty much there are a couple major things to know about the class:

  Each board instance has two 2 dimensional lists (matrices):
    one matrix is the current state of the puzzle
    the other matrix is the goal state of the puzzle
  Each board instance also has 2 dictionary objects (pythons hashtable implementation):
    one dictionary holds coordinates (i, j) for each number in the current state of the puzzle
    the other dictionary holds coords for each number in the goal state of the puzzle
  
In terms of methods, there are a couple of important ones:
  board_object.move(n):
    since the only piece we are actually going to move is the zero, we just specify
    whether we want it to move Left, Right, Up, or Down. So the argument n in the 
    move functions corresponds to this 0=L, 1=R, 2=U, 3=D. It returns true and changes the
    current state if it was a valid move (ie it didnt go out of bounds on the board)

  board_object.mismatches():
    simply compares our current matrix with the goal matrix and returns the number of positions
    that our current matrix differs from the goal matrix

  board_object.print_matrix():
    pretty self explanatory prints the current state of the matrix to terminal, you can type 'goal'
    as the argument to print the goal matrix if you want
    also prints board_objects.mismatches() as the bottom line
